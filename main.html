      My name is Denise.

       highschool. 2 MORE YEARS !! so exciteeed. When I graduate I plan to attend
       an university and major in law.

      I have alot of hobbies. Everything there is... i've done. For example,
      piano, guitar, violen, ballet, basketball, chess, art, singing, Dancing

      I have a bit of a big family.I have 8 sisters and 2 brothers. I am a middle child. Yeah hard to believe
      Its not that fun. Always getting nagged on because your not the older but your not the oldest.
      But its okay I still love my crazy family.
